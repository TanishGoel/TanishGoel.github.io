        <div id="first">Hello! I am Tanish Goel-- a computing student at 
            Imperial College London.
        </div>

        <div id="second">I took a philosophy course in the fall, 
            which piqued my interest in the subject quite a bit and
            I ended up reading Plato's <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30292.Five_Dialogues">
            Five Dialogues</a></em> (blew my mind away btw).
        </div>
        
        <div id="third">I won the National Youth Award, the highest
            civilian honor in India for a high school student, met and talked with the Prime Minister
            and President of India about my aspirations. The Prime Minister 
            ended up <a href="https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/1220703661011144711?lang=en">
            tweeting</a> about me.
        </div>
        <div id="fourth">As a teenager, I won the NASA Goddard Award
            at the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida. My team came up
            with a really cool way to predict crowd behaviour and 
            make large events like concerts safer.
        </div>
        <div id="fifth">In grade 10, I emailed a bunch of local universities,
            asking about research opportunities in artificial intelligence. My
            "spam everyone/everything" approach worked. I was accepted into
            an amazing summer research in ML/AI internship program as the only
            highschool student. There, I came up
            with an algorithm to detect emotions through facial expressions and speech
            analysis, which was pretty cool.
        </div>
        <div id="sixth">I consider myself to be a creative. You'll usually find me working
            on graphic designs or projects that really intrigued me. If you  want 
            to collab on something cool then feel free to reach out (email is ideal).
        </div>
        <div id="seventh">I am trying to be more creative while managing my uni workload.
            It is proving to be difficult though. But, stay tuned as I figure this out.
            Hear about it on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_tanishgoel_/">my Instagram</a>.
