                <p>Hi! I am a first year student at <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London</a>, 
                who is pursuing a degree in computing (AI+ML). I like to build things with code and 
                design. I read, dream, and jog. </p>
                <p>In summer 2020, I enhanced my skills, did some cool projects, and watched 
                    "a little" <a href="https://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a>.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="heading"><h1>Past Acts üì∞</h1></div>
            <div class="past">
                <p>This summer, I took basic regression and machine learning courses from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com">Kaggle</a>.
                I took part in a hackathon where my team created a bias analyzing software called <a href="https://taar.herokuapp.com/">taar</a>
                using basic NLP (applying NLP for the first time so you might encounter some bugs, feel free to reach out and discuss).
                Also, I tried to launch a podcast with some <a href="https://www.ucla.edu">UCLA</a> and <a href="https://www.nyu.edu">NYU</a> students on global events.</p>
                <p>At 17, I was honored by the Prime Minister and President of India for winning <a href="https://nca-wcd.nic.in/">President's National Child Award</a> in the category of innovation.
                    In high school, I won the <a href="https://www.conradchallenge.org/">Conrad Challenge</a> and became a Junior Member at the 
                    <a href="https://www.nyas.org/programs/global-stem-alliance/the-junior-academy/">New York Academy of Sciences</a>. After a few successful projects at the Academy, I became a Global Stem Alliance Partner to support it in its future endeavours.  
                </p>
                <p>At DPS RK Puram, I led three of the most active and selective clubs in Delhi in some capacity. I was one of the five students inducted out of 350 in the computer club. I sat through countless interview rounds to become the design and tech head at TEDx. And, I took multiple induction tests to get into the entrepreneurship club.</p>
                <p>I led the entrepreneurship club as president. Here, I championed a new induction process based on logical and creative thinking. Due to my measures the club had its biggest applicant pool of 300 in 2019. One of the questions was:</p>
                <p class="q">Q.) Congrats! Your company just grossed over a million dollars in profits. Now that you‚Äôve entered the big leagues, you are faced with an extremely tough decision. You have realised that taxes increase steeply in your country after crossing the million dollar mark. You can either choose to pay these or avoid them like Apple and Amazon do. You know that avoiding taxes is unethical and more importantly the money stashed away in Ireland or the Caymans can‚Äôt be used directly. You also know that these taxes won‚Äôt leave much in your company‚Äôs coffers. What do you do? There are no right or wrong answers-- we want to understand how you think.</p>
                <p>I was taken on board as an adivsor by my computer club in the final year at high school. In the club, I organized, participated, and won in Hackathons across New Delhi. I was on the organizing team of the biggest high school IT fest in India, <a href="https://exunclan.com/">Exun</a>. Furthermore, my batch organized the first ever Exun Summer Sprint-- a project showcase competition, where we mentored teams of high school enthusiasts into creating something meaningful during the summer break.</p>

            <div class="cool">
                <p>The Prime Minister of India tweeted about me. Find the tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/1220703661011144711">here</a>. The image isn't my best to be honest, but a pretty cool thing nonetheless.</p>
                <p>I love to ski and go to do so near the Indian borders of Kashmir annually. There, I have heard live gunfire from the active <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_wars_and_conflicts">India-Pakistan border</a> and went on scenic walks through strawberry fields.</p>
                <p>My favourite cuisine is Thai and I love the taste of coconuts.</p>
                <p>I have recently started and suprisingly continued working out. I find physical exercise rewarding and de-stressing.</p>
                <p>This is what I and my mom look like:</p>
